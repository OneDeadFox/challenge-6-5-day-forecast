## Description


This is a weather app that pulls data from two separate apis to first determine the users desired location and then provide weather data on that area.
The provided weather data includes the current weather for the specified location and a 5 day forecast with averaged weather values.
This app is mobile friendly and will display the same data as in desktop view but in an accordion.
The six most recent searches will appear in search history under the search bar. Duplicate inqureies move that item to the top of the list.
